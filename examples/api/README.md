# API
This example application shows a basic API implementation using Fireball.
The following elements are shown here:
* Returning JSON responses from Handlers
* Using a custom App.ErrorHandler to send all errors as JSON
* Using path variables in routes
* Using basic data persistence in a web application (using [go-sdata](https://github.com/zpatrick/go-sdata))



## Run Example
From this directory, run:
```
go run main.go
```

The username and password is "user" and "pass"
